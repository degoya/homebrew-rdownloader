  def install
    # The archive is the portable layout, and it stays together in libexec: the service installs
    # its bundled plugins from plugins/ beside the executable, and the macOS NZB helper app starts
    # the rdownloader-capture beside itself. bin/ gets scripts that exec the real files, because
    # through a symlink the executable would look for plugins/ in bin/ on macOS. The launcher
    # scripts are left out: they keep PID files and logs next to themselves, in the Cellar.

      Start the service now and at every login, then open http://127.0.0.1:8710 for the setup
      wizard:
        brew services start rdownloader

      The service runs in #{var}/rdownloader: the database and the installed plugins in data/,
      the default download folder in downloads/. Upgrades keep both. Leave the autostart to
      `brew services`: it starts the service in that folder, while `rdownloader autostart
      install` would start it with its working folder inside the installation.

      The desktop capture agent (Click'n'Load, clipboard, .nzb files) is installed beside it; its
      own formula starts it at every login:
        brew install degoya/rdownloader/rdownloader-capture

      Media, stream and archive features need their external tools, for example:
        brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp
    EOS
    if OS.mac?
      text += <<~EOS

        The macOS binaries are ad-hoc signed, not notarized. Homebrew's download carries no
        quarantine flag, so Gatekeeper lets them run.

      text += <<~EOS

        The Linux binaries need glibc 2.39 or newer (`ldd --version`).
